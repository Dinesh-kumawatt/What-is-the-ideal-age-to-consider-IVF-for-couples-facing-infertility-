# What-is-the-ideal-age-to-consider-IVF-for-couples-facing-infertility-

There’s no one perfect age to go for IVF, but doctors do agree that starting earlier usually gives better results. That’s because fertility naturally declines with age, especially for women. For most couples, if they've been trying for over a year (or 6 months if the woman is over 35) and haven’t conceived, it's time to consider fertility tests and possibly IVF.

The ideal age range for IVF is generally between 25 to 35 years for women. This is when the ovaries still have a good number of eggs, and the quality is higher too. If IVF is done during this window, chances of success are much better. For women under 35, the success rate of IVF can go above 60–70% in good clinics.

After 35, it’s still possible to conceive through IVF, but the chances begin to drop. Egg quality reduces, and conditions like fibroids or hormonal imbalance may start appearing. By age 40, IVF success rates go down to around 20–30%, and after 42, it’s even lower unless donor eggs are used.

For men, age also matters, though not as sharply. Sperm quality may decline slightly after 40–45 years, but men can still father children later in life. However, lifestyle choices like smoking, stress, and lack of sleep also affect sperm health.

When to consider IVF early:

If you have PCOS, endometriosis, or blocked tubes

If male partner has low sperm count or motility

If periods are irregular or menopause is approaching

If other fertility treatments (like IUI) have failed

If both partners are above 35 and trying for over 6 months

One thing many people wait too long for is hoping things will happen naturally. Waiting is okay for a few months, but too much delay can affect your success rates and emotional well-being too.

That’s why it’s important to talk to a fertility expert early—just for an assessment at least. They’ll check your hormone levels, egg count (AMH), sperm health, and advise whether you need IVF or something else.
